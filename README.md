## Abstract


India has enough food; does it have too many people working in agriculture? The pressure on land is an outcome of policy, which condemns most people to marginal farming. India needs a different set of solutions for agriculture and for those working the land. Therefore, It is high time for introducing Intelligent technologies into Agriculture to gain “Precision Agriculture”.

With the help of Digital Kisaan Portal we address the problems faced using Live crop prediction and recommendation for precise agricultural practices with a growing support community to help farmers with their day to day challenges and also socializing their success.
